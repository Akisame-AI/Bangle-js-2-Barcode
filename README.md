# Bangle-js-2-Barcode

This app allows Bangle.js 2 users to generate and display barcodes directly from their smartwatches. Whether it's for quick access to membership cards or sharing product codes, this app enhances the utility of your Bangle.js 2 watch.

## Features

- Generate and display EAN13 barcodes.

- **Usability Enhancements**: Implement functionality to switch between different barcodes.
- **User Interface**: Overhaul the UI for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Settings Page**: Allow users to customize and configure the app according to their preferences.
